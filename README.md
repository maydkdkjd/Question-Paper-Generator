# Question-Paper-Generator
The application generates questions on the basis of the marks and difficulty level for the specified subject (PCM). It takes marks, subject, difficulty(easy, medium, hard) as an input and returns the questions list as an output on the console.
It is developed using HTML, Javascript, Node.js and Express.js. HTML has beed used to make the UI with the help of the Bootstrap. Javascript, Node.js and Express.js are working behind the scenes to filter the questions from the dataset Questions(JSON file).
